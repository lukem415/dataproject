# dataproject

This was one of my Summer 2016 projects at my internship.

Steps:

1.Place your main folder on your desktop
2. Download zip file and extract files into your main folder
3. Have the ‘Kinetic.xlsm’ and ‘macro.vbs’ files in your main folder
4. ‘testing1.xlsm’ should be inside of the ‘final’ folder, which is inside of your main folder
5. Click ‘macro.vbs’ to run the script
6. In each subfolder, there will be a new workbook titled ‘KineticX.xlsm’, where X is an integer
7. All of ‘KineticX.xlsm’ are merged into the ‘testing1.xlsm’ workbook inside of the ‘final’ folder
